# Recommendations
"","","","","Recommendation: migrate feature-by-feature. Suggested order: booking (largest + parameterized), providers, home, services, help_support, notifications, profile, auth, payment. Maintain the generated AppLocalizations delegate in app until all files migrated. For parameterized messages, format args to strings before calling tr() and use namedArgs (recommended) for clarity."
