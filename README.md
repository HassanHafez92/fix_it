## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.10.0 or later
- Dart SDK 3.0.0 or later
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter plugins
- iOS development: Xcode 14+ (for iOS builds)
- Firebase project setup

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL_HERE]
   cd fix_it
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup** (Required)
   - Follow the detailed guide in [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md)
   - Configure Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore
   - Add platform-specific configuration files

4. **Environment Configuration**

   ```bash
   # Copy and configure environment variables
   # Unix / macOS / WSL
   cp lib/app_config.dart.template lib/app_config.dart

   # Windows PowerShell
   Copy-Item lib/app_config.dart.template lib/app_config.dart

   # Update lib/app_config.dart with your API keys and configuration,
   # or supply values at build/run time with --dart-define.
   ```

5. **Generate Code** (if needed)

   ```bash
   # Recommended: run build_runner and delete conflicting outputs
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

   # Or watch mode while developing
   flutter packages pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs

   # Note: some generated files (for example, *.g.dart) are intended to be
   # committed in this repo. If your CI or reviewers expect generated files,
   # commit them. Otherwise keep them out of source control per your project policy.
   ```

6. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   # Debug mode
   flutter run

   # Specific platform
   flutter run -d android
   flutter run -d ios
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

```

### Code Generation

```bash
# Generate JSON serialization code
flutter packages pub run build_runner build

# Watch for changes
flutter packages pub run build_runner watch
```

### State Management

The app uses **BLoC pattern** for state management:

- Events trigger state changes
- States represent UI conditions
- Blocs contain business logic
- Cubits for simpler state management
