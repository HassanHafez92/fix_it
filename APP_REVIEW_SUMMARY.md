# Fix It App Review - Screen Visibility Issues Fixed

## Overview
After reviewing the Fix It app against the technical plan, I identified and resolved several missing screen routes that were preventing users from accessing all implemented functionality.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Route Registrations
**Problem**: Several screens were implemented but not registered in the app's routing system, making them inaccessible.

**Fixed Screens**:
- ✅ Edit Profile Screen (`/edit-profile`)
- ✅ Change Password Screen (`/change-password`)  
- ✅ Payment Methods Screen (`/payment-methods`)
- ✅ About Screen (`/about`) - Now with proper BLoC integration
- ✅ Contact Support Screen (`/contact-support`)
- ✅ Service Selection Screen (`/service-selection`)
- ✅ Provider Search Screen (`/provider-search`)
- ✅ Provider Availability Screen (`/provider-availability`)
- ✅ Booking Flow Screen (`/booking-flow`)

### 2. Missing Import Statements
**Problem**: Required screen imports were missing from the routes file.

**Fixed**: Added all missing imports for:
- Profile management screens
- Payment screens
- Help & support screens
- Provider search functionality
- Booking flow screens
- Required BLoC providers

### 3. BLoC Integration Issues
**Problem**: Some screens were missing proper BLoC provider setup in routes.

**Fixed**: 
- AboutScreen now properly integrated with AboutBloc
- All other screens have correct BLoC providers
